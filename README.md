It's built in so you can review the most important terms without the need of a Web explorer or even Internet after a first-time app run, the terms will download automatically.
The version 1.0 contains more than 100 Android concepts and components, all double-checked with their principal and supported documentation if we don't have a term's data it will just send you to the main source.
